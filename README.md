# Logcrypted
> Security? None. <br>
   Coolness? 0. <br>
   Next to no storage? I guess.

Hi! My name is Shayaan Doodekula. I made Logcrypted to store data in plain sight. If you're lazy like me, you don't wanna do all that work to store data about a person. Instead, you just wanna put that data somewhere you can see it, and they can ignore it. (Please don't do this for actual projects, only for fun and lazy bumness). Logcrypted allows you to send as much data as possible using as few characters neccessary. By utilizing the Cantor pairing function, we can combine two characters into one. 

# ðŸš€ Use Cases
* Lazy Bumness: If you have a lil' game, say, [Blackjack](https://github.com/shayaan-d/The-House-Always-Wins), you can send over the deck using Logcrypted! I used this in THAW by sending the deck and the dealer's hand through the footer (shush no cheating.)
* User "friendlyness": Because of how few characters Logcryption has, it's an easy way to cross check if data is sending correctly. You can also "add" to the ASCII value of the characters to shift it into emojis, which is easier for human brains to crosscheck.
